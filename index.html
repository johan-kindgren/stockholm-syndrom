        <h2>What Is Stockholm Syndrome?</h2>
        <p>“In the simplest terms, Stockholm syndrome refers to the experience of a victim having positive feelings towards their perpetrator,” says Melissa Goldberg Mintz, a licensed clinical psychologist in Houston, Texas and author of Has Your Child Been Traumatized?</p>
        <p>From a psychological perspective, if you can identify with the person holding you captive or abusing you—so someone whose motives you can relate to, or feel some type of sympathy or compassion towards—it may feel a lot less terrifying than someone who seems truly unredeemable or evil, she explains.</p>
        <p>Noel Hunter, a clinical psychologist and director of MindClear Integrative Psychotherapy in New York City, explains that this psychological defense may also allow for survival among some victims who learn to develop a close attachment with their abuser.</p>
        <p>“When a caregiver or a person on whom a person relies for food, safety and shelter is also one’s abuser, the victim is trapped,” says Dr. Hunter. “They can’t attack their caregiver or risk pushing them away as they are completely dependent on this person. At the same time, they are being tortured and/or abused.”</p>
        <p>To justify abuse, Dr. Hunter says the victim may idealize their caregiver and view any inflicted torture as their own fault. “The victim takes on a mindset that is almost symbiotic with the abuser in order to please the caregiver and get in their good graces,” explains Dr. Hunter. “They may believe that the more they bond with the abuser, the less likely they are to be abused, and this is often the case.”</p>
