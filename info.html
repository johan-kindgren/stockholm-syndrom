        <h1>What is Stockholm syndrome?</h1>
        <h3><u>Stockholm syndrome</u></h3>
        <p>Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response to being held captive. People with Stockholm syndrome form a psychological connection with their captors and begin sympathizing with them.</p>
      
    
        <h3><u>Other closely linked psychological conditions include:</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trauma bonding.</li>
            <li>Learned helplessness.</li>
            <li>Battered person syndrome.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3><u>How did Stockholm syndrome get its name?</u></h3>
        <p>This condition gets its name from a 1973 bank robbery incident that happened in Stockholm, Sweden. During the six-day standoff with police, many of the captive bank employees became sympathetic toward the bank robbers. After they were set free, some bank employees refused to testify against the bank robbers in court and even raised money for their defense.</p>
        <p>A criminologist and psychiatrist investigating the event developed the term, “Stockholm syndrome” to describe the affinity some bank employees showed toward the bank robbers.</p>
    
        <h1>Symptoms and Causes</h1>
        <h3><u>What are the symptoms of Stockholm syndrome?</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive feelings toward the captors or abusers.</li>
            <li>Negative feelings toward police or other authority figures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other symptoms are similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flashbacks.</li>
            <li>Feeling distrustful, irritated, jittery, or anxious.</li>
            <li>Can’t relax or enjoy things that you previously enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Trouble concentrating.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>What causes Stockholm syndrome?</h1>
        <h3><u>Researchers don’t know why some captives develop Stockholm syndrome and others don’t.</u></h3>
        <p>One theory is that this is a learned technique passed down from our ancestors. In the early civilization, there was always a risk of being captured or killed by another social group.</p>
        <p>Bonding with captors increased the chance of survival. Some evolutionary psychiatrists believe this ancestral technique is a natural human trait.</p>
        <p>Another theory is that a captive or abuse situation is highly emotionally charged. People adjust their feelings and start having compassion for their abuser when they’re shown some kindness over time. Also, by working with and not fighting against an abuser, victims may secure their safety. When not harmed by their abuser, a victim may feel grateful and even view their abuser as humane.</p>
    
        <h1>Diagnosis and Tests</h1>
        <h3><u>How is Stockholm syndrome diagnosed?</u></h3>
        <p>The American Psychiatric Association doesn’t officially recognize or include Stockholm syndrome as a condition in its latest diagnostic manual — the gold standard of mental health diseases and conditions.</p>
        <p>Because it’s not included, healthcare providers may or may not recognize this condition. However, all healthcare providers recognize behaviors that result from a traumatic situation.</p>
        <p>The criteria for PTSD or acute stress disorder and some treatments are often similar to Stockholm syndrome.</p>
    
        <h1>Norrmalmstorg robbery</h1>
        <p>The Norrmalmstorg robbery was a bank robbery and hostage crisis that occurred at the Norrmalmstorg Square in Stockholm, Sweden, in August 1973 and was the first crime in Sweden to be covered by live television. It is best known as the origin of the term Stockholm syndrome.</p>
        <p>Jan-Erik Olsson was a convicted criminal who had disappeared while on furlough from prison and then held up the Kreditbanken bank, taking four hostages in the process. During the negotiations that followed,</p>
        <p>Swedish Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer allowed Olsson's former cellmate and friend Clark Olofsson to be brought from prison to the bank. Although Olofsson was a long-time career criminal, it was deemed unlikely that he was in league with Olsson. In the popular account, the hostages then bonded with their captors and refused to cooperate with police.</p>
        <p>However, it has also been argued that the hostages were simply distrustful of the police given the latter's willingness to risk the hostages' safety. Police finally mounted a tear-gas attack five days into the crisis, and the robbers surrendered.</p>
        <p>Olsson was sentenced to 10 years for the robbery, and Olofsson was ultimately acquitted. The counter-intuitive actions of the hostages led to a great deal of academic and public interest in the case, including a 2003 Swedish television film titled Norrmalmstorg, a 2018 Canadian film titled Stockholm, and a 2022 Swedish Netflix television series Clark.</p>
    
        <h1 id="stockholm-syndrome">What Is Stockholm Syndrome? Symptoms, Causes And Treatment</h1>
        <p>Pop culture often portrays Stockholm syndrome in scenarios where kidnapping survivors fall in love with, express sympathy for, or conspire alongside their captors. One infamous example occurred in 1974 when a group of domestic terrorists kidnapped 19-year-old American media heiress Patty Hearst. After her abduction, Hearst announced her support of the group and assisted her captors in a bank robbery.</p>
