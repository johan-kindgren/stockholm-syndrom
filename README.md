# stockholm-syndrom

"I have created a page about the mentioned advice and the Stockholm Syndrome. It revolves around a scenario where one person attempts a robbery, and the police request another robber's assistance to resolve the situation. However, the situation takes an unexpected turn when the hostage begins to develop positive feelings toward the robbers, giving rise to what is commonly known as Stockholm Syndrome."
